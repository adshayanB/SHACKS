## Inspiration ðŸ’¡

The focus of S Hacks is to bridge the technological gap between those who can't use modern day technology or simply do not have access to it. We want to give this demographic of individuals a means to still use modern day technology at their convenience and ease. A staple in our modern day society is simple, a working cellphone. While some individuals might not have their own PCs, workstations, IPads and other devices, these same individuals will most likely have at least a phone. 

Our team wanted to utilize this fact and common base of individuals to build something that would allow individuals that have any phone to use modern day tools and services, regardless of if the person had a smart phone, was an elderly person, or not tech saavy. Introducing NAME, NAME allows any phone user to use text messages to access online banking services usually accessed through a mobile app or website. 

## What It Does ðŸ˜ƒ

NAME is a backend service that a bank can implement to allow it's clients to text a number to view their banking information and perform other actions as well. Users can text the number provided to them a variety of commands and will receive a response back instantly via SMS. Users can also text this number to be provided a growing list of commands to ensure clients can utilize this service to it's maximum potential. We hope that this service allows individuals who maybe aren't the best at using mobile/desktop apps, or those with phones incapable of downloading apps, or those without an internet connection, can use this eervice to stay connected and in power of their finances.
